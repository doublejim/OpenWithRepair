# Open-With Repair
An application for editing what command is executed, when opening a file with an application on Windows.

This program was created on Windows 7. It has not yet been tested on other editions of Windows.

Occasionally, when using the right-click "Open with" menu, and selecting an application to open a file with, the application doesn't show up on the list. This problem exists at least on Windows XP and Windows 7.
Open-With Repair was created to easily repair the configuration, when this problem occurs.
The program shows all of the applications known to be able to open files. The commands seen are what's happening when a file is opened with an application.

You may choose to either change or delete an entry. If you delete an entry, Windows won't know that it can "Open with" the application of the deleted entry. The next time you open a file associated with the application, Windows will either ask you which application should be used to open the file, or it will choose an application known to be able to.
Changing an entry involves changing the path or arguments of an application. That's useful in case you have installed several versions of softwares with the same exe-filenames, and Windows has messed up the association.
